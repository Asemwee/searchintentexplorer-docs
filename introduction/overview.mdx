# Search Intent Explorer

Search Intent Explorer helps you identify which theoretical search intents are backed by real user demand.

Starting from a main entity and its properties, the tool generates theoretical intents and analyzes whether they match real Google search suggestions.

The goal is to identify which intents actually exist before investing in SEO content or landing pages.
